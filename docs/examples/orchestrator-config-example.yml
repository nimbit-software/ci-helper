# Orchestrator Configuration Example
# This file demonstrates all available orchestrator settings that can be configured via YAML

# Directory containing the packages to deploy
packagesDir: ../../integration-toolkit/packages

# Path to deployment configuration (file, folder, or URL)
# - Single file:  ./001-deploy-config.yml
# - Folder:       ./configs (processes all *.yml files)
# - Remote URL:   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/main/config.yml
deployConfig: ../../integration-toolkit/deployments

# Optional: Deployment prefix for package/artifact IDs
# This will be prepended to all package and artifact IDs
# Example: "DEV" -> package becomes "DEVMyPackage"
deploymentPrefix: ""

# Optional: Filter packages by name (comma-separated)
# Only these packages will be processed
# Example: "DeviceManagement,GenericPipeline"
packageFilter: ""

# Optional: Filter artifacts by name (comma-separated)
# Only these artifacts will be processed
# Example: "MDMEquipmentMutationOutbound,CustomerDataSync"
artifactFilter: ""

# Optional: File pattern for config files when using folder source
# Default: "*.y*ml" (matches both .yml and .yaml)
configPattern: "*.y*ml"

# Optional: Merge multiple config files into single deployment
# Default: false (process each config separately)
# When true: All configs are merged and deployed together with their prefixes
mergeConfigs: true

# Optional: Keep temporary directory after execution
# Default: false (cleanup temp files)
# Useful for debugging - temp dir contains modified artifacts
keepTemp: false

# Operation mode: "update-and-deploy", "update-only", or "deploy-only"
# - update-and-deploy: Update artifacts, then deploy them (default)
# - update-only:       Only update artifacts, skip deployment
# - deploy-only:       Only deploy artifacts, skip updates
mode: "update-and-deploy"

# Deployment Settings (Phase 2 - Parallel Deployment)

# Number of status check retries for each deployment
# Default: 5
# Each retry waits for deployDelaySeconds before checking again
deployRetries: 5

# Delay in seconds between deployment status checks
# Default: 15
# Increase this if deployments take longer in your environment
deployDelaySeconds: 15

# Maximum number of parallel deployments per package
# Default: 3
# Increase for faster deployments (but watch for rate limits)
# Decrease if you hit API rate limits or memory constraints
parallelDeployments: 10
